# Fun-with-Matrices
By request, fills up a matrix NxN with random values. Then checks if the determinant is 1 or -1 to find an inverse matrix with only integer values.

### Details
Makes use of the random method and geeksforgeeks.org/determinant-of-a-matrix/ code before rendering the matrix in the console.

#### Potential Improvements
At least narrow the scope of randomness to be able to find these inverse integer matrices in a much shorter time.
